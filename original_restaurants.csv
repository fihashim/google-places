Such intriguing dining concepts are becoming increasingly popular worldwide. This DarkRestaurant offers a dining experience shrouded in complete darkness, served by visually impaired waitstaff. The prospect was intriguing, yet no amount of anticipation could truly prepare me for the depth of the experience that lay ahead. In this environment, ""utter darkness"" means the absence of all light, making it impossible to see anything at all.\n\nUpon our arrival, the hostess warmly greeted my date and me, taking our coats and presenting a menu that outlined meal types rather than specific dishes—poultry, seafood, beef, or vegetarian options, with a selection of drinks. I opted for the vegetarian, and my date chose beef. We were then led by our blind server, Heedi, in a conga line fashion into the pitch-black dining area, a journey that set the stage for an evening unlike any other.\n\nSeated and acquainted with our surroundings through touch—silverware, glasses, and more—courtesy of Heedi\'s guidance, we awaited our meal. The palpable darkness soon unsettled us, a feeling exacerbated by the inability of our eyes to adjust or find light. To distract from the discomfort, we engaged in conversation.\n\nThe meal began with bread that, to my discerning palate, immediately felt unworthy of indulgence. A playful moment ensued when my date, attempting to lighten the mood, inadvertently launched a piece of crust into my eye. Despite the mishap, we navigated the challenges of sharing dishes and experiencing the meal without sight, which proved messy yet enlightening. Our main courses arrived, and though my initial impression was of a simple salad, I was actually enjoying a complex dish of lime-marinated beetroot with a mint topping, a discovery that underscored how much sight influences taste.\n\nThis dining-in-the-dark experience taught us valuable lessons about the reliance on visual cues in culinary enjoyment and the profound impact of sight on our dining experiences. Despite the average quality of the meals, the unique environment made for a memorable evening, though not one we\'re likely to repeat. The experience served as a reminder of the importance of sight and the intriguing ways in which its absence can alter perception, conversation, and even the ambiance of a meal. Dining in the dark offers a one-of-a-kind experience that goes beyond food to challenge and enlighten the senses in unexpected ways.', ""I absolutely adored the experience and the atmosphere!

The problem is this.. Their idiot tough guy who was the first server was so rude and uncomfortable with us that we couldn't shake that feeling of not being wanted. THEN, and have picture to PROVE, I found a black human hair in my chicken madras. Very irritating especially after having eaten most of it already. There is no reason for hair in food if you make everyone entering a kitchen wear a hair net. Just like you should wear gloves when preparing foods. So, all put together, I feel I'm being generous.

The Museum Island was crowded with visitors relaxing and enjoying the sun. The Forum is located at the center of the island, and next to the subway line 5. The visit to Humboldt Forum was very pleasant. The collections are mostly free. Couple of highlights about its facility: 1. lockers and cloakroom allows flight carry on size luggage, and check them for visitors for free. 2. There is a bistro with various reasonably priced lunch options. 3. Roof terrace costs 5 Euro for access. But one can make a reservation at its roof terrace restaurant Baret to enjoy a cup of coffee and the Dom view. I went there for its Asian Art collection located on the third floor, and happily surprised with its temporary collections there, especially with the Wang Shu designed exhibition hall. Of course, one question the visitors might have after reading the descriptions of some of the objects in the hall is  the museum\'s efforts and role in addressing the ethical dilemma of preserving those admittedly ""looted"" during the Boxer Rebellion. Overall, the Forum also made efforts in including more English language description of objects that\'s more friendly to non-German speaking visitors. At the beginning of the Asian Art collection, there is also a timeline of the transformation of its collection since 19th century. One suggestion for future improvement of presenting such a timeline is to use different colors for English and German texts, and explain acronyms on the side. It would be easier for the visitors to follow.', ""Lovely and magical place, for me it's one of the best places and one of the  best areas in Berlin.

Great fun!\n\nOur prior experience, both at the old location and new, has been nothing but positive. Attentive staff, busy vibe and amazing food. However, there were some issues this time around that has made us wondering if this was our last visit.\n\nOur reserved slot was 18.00 to 20.00. We were welcomed and seated immediately upon arrival but then had to wait nearly 20 minutes before staff took drink orders. The starter wasn’t served until almost an hour after we arrived. To our knowledge at the time this left us possibly with only an hour to finish a 9 course meal. The dessert was served at about 20.00, so luckily it wasn’t as tight as feared.\nYet again when we had finished our meal we also had to wait a long time at the bar to get to pay our bill.\n\nUnfortunately staff did not have time to pay much attention to our table during our stay. By the time we left staff had not taken a single drink-order from us, we had to make the request and generally it took some effort and waiting to communicate, as they were super busy running back and forth. Even presenting the menu and taking orders they appeared in a rush, talking very fast and «on the go».\n\nStarter:\nThe seasoned bread was nice but dry. Some of the dishes that we expected to be served warm arrived cold at the table. Unsure if it was supposed to be like that, but the grilled cauliflower, falafel and roasted potatoes would have been nice served warm. The potatoes were somewhat chewy and falafel was not moist like before, unfortunately dry. The hummus was lovely, like before, however served with much added tahini now which camouflaged the hummus flavour and made it somewhat bland.\n\nMains:\nBy the time our mains arrived we were starting to feel full already. So great value for money, but quite overwhelming.\n\nDessert:\nCoconunt pannacotta with pistachio crumble and a fruit sauce was lovely, but then again we were very, very full at this point.\n\nAll in all we spent the majority of our visit waiting, and less time enjoying the food and taking the time to process and taste the lovely foods and flavours. Such a shame.\n\nThe large portions are great if you have a big appetite and are a fast eater. We could’ve enjoyed half the size and therefore miss the opportunity of a la carte.\n\nThe belly dancer was definitely a highlight, thank you for the entertaining show and spreading love!\n\nEdit: Would like to add that the staff was very friendly also this time.

I‘ve to admit, I gave the place a first check by visiting the Bar for some drinks after a stroll with a friend on Oranienstreet the other day.

As well I‘d the opportunity to run some wonderful & mystic places as part of an awesome team myself.\nOk. Let’s cut the marketing blabla.

On top of that the food was accompanied by an out of ordinary level of service. I‘d guess, that over the 4 courses we‘d had a minimum of 10 different service & chef people at the table. Might sound stressful, but believe me, it was a pure pleasure to get to know every single one of them, especially because of their so much away from average commitment & positive energy which came with each & everyone!\nFolks, hands on my heart, I paid the full bill and this feedback is 100% personal, not paid at all and simply based on my beliefs to „give back“!\nBefore ending, my wife’s favorite part of a menu is the dessert (-> yeahhh, she’s a true sweetheart 😍) and even here, these crazy folks not only send their „TV style Pattissière“ to our table, but she also dropped some freaking amazing, no chi-chi & simply really tasty desserts.\nOk. I get it. It’s seems far too much for an unpaid review, but hej, how much crap, average, overrated and simply „not ever come back shit“ have you been going through!?\nSo I thought, I‘d might want to allow myself to get really carried away for once 😉!\nAgain, very personal, very much of a Monday evening and very-very slightly infused by birthday emotions.\nSimply fueled by a very special experience, which I believe needs to be shared! N-joy folks!', ""Returning to Orania for my second visit was an absolute delight.

I ate a big pizza and when I finished it I wanted another one :D.\nToday, I was like: I either do the most stupid spending of all times or I get myself not one, not 2, but 3 slices of heaven.

I chose this restaurant because my dad was in town, we love italian food so after reading the extraordinary good reviews and seeing the nice website with a nice menu selection, I wanted to give it a try.\n(I worked years in restaurants and I am a big foodie, especially for my italian food, so I love to try new stuff, because why not, it‘s berlin right?)\n\nThe place:\nWe get there and it is just a brightly lit room with a big window so you can see the whole restaurant. Because the first impression was sadly uninviting (compared to other romantic italian places in berlin) I even had to check if that is the right restaurant because the place looked nothing like the photos, but we were right.\nThe atmosphere and ambiance was just… cold. You walk straight into the dining area with tables scrambled together, bright lights, no candles, no nice tablecloths, just straight up cheap tables and chairs. The chairs are unfortunately also so uncomfortable, that we wanted to go right after eating. For every restaurant, but especially italian, I want to be comfortable. I want to feel at home. I want the feeling I am in Italy right now and I can sit and sit forever and just have nice hour long conversations over a bottle or two of red wine. But all I got from there was just a reaction to stand up and go. I‘m sorry to be so direct but I have no other way to describe it.\nThe most sad part about it: one reason I chose the restaurant was by the way they decorated and printed their menu. (It sounds dumb but after years of trying new restaurants you know when they put in the work for a nice menu, they will do with everything else as well).\nSo I was flabbergasted when the waiter just lay the menu cards down, which were just flipchart boards with a old laminated printed out sheet of paper.\n\nThe food:\nWell the food. As stated above we ended up paying 180€ for 3 persons, which isn’t THAT much for berlin, but everytime I pay that much I get a really overall nice experience from the places. So, as you can imagine, this place was nowhere near that.\nMy girlfriend and I had roman artichokes as starters, my dad had porchetta with radicchio. The artichokes were ok, but they just tasted… bland (i guess?!), my dad described as: „They lack the kick“. The porchetta was fine.\nFor main we had: octopus, ravioli with cod and tagliolini with calamaretti.\nAnd now it got disappointing for that price: my dad had the octopus main and he got 2 half arms. Like maybe 100g, if even. It tasted good, a little bit too long cooked on one side, so octopus gets rubbery. But like the size was just a joke. I‘m sorry to be so blunt. This dish was 28€(!). I had the ravioli and also here taste was ok, but they lacked a bit of everything and for about 26€ it was just to small (had like 7 ravioli) and too little kick to it. My gf had the tagliolini, which was surprisingly a huge portion, compared to ours. I just don‘t get their measurements of plating?\nWell the taste was also good but lacked something and were a bit to bitter. I mean that‘s a dish for normally around 16-18€ and it was also like 26€.\n\nSo all in all I want to say that the food was not bad or uneatable. But we paid 180€ which is just not right for what you get. A ok-quality food with lack of passion behind the taste and an unromantic atmosphere where you don’t want to stay hours.\nSo my rating is 2 stars for that the food was ok and the chef was nice, but I‘m sorry. Didn‘t get the vibe and sadly not something to visit again.']","[2, 5, 2]"
